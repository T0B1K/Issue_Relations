Below you will find a very reduced Dockerfile and a build.bat script to reproduce the problem.\r\n\r\nIf running the build.bat with the `svn exports` during `docker build` it will work. no freezing of the terminal.\r\n\r\nIf running the build.bat in a started container \r\n1) `docker run --rm -it {BUILD-IMAGE} powershell`\r\n2) remove folders from building the container:\r\n```\r\nPS C:\\> Remove-Item -Recurse -Force C:\\openssl-1.0.2j\r\nPS C:\\> Remove-Item -Recurse -Force C:\\bzip2-1.0.6\r\n```\r\n3) `PS C:\\> build.bat`\r\n\r\nthe output of subversion will freeze (sometimes earlier then other times), the container is still in state running. `docker exec -it {CONTAINER} powershell` works.

Ironically, the major performance improvement in Docker Desktop 2.2.0.0 would have been likely to make NFS a no-op, not necessary. \r\n\r\nAn initial review of this (without NFS) may suggest that ddev is not detecting those symlinks in order to convert them to windows symlinks. It will take some debugging time to sort it out. I guess it's to be expected since they changed the whole mount style.\r\n\r\nThe reason I never detected this working on Windows with Docker edge is that I invariably use NFS for performance reasons, and recommend it to everyone.\r\n"},{"createdAt":"2020-01-22T17:10:50Z","body":"I'm going to close this as a duplicate of https://github.com/drud/ddev/issues/2046 - Since ddev can't find symlinks that have been created in the container, it can't update them.

If I only have the service who run my symfony the sync will work.\r\n\r\n### Information\r\n  - Is it reproducible? Yes, every time\r\n  - Is the problem new? Yes, only with 2.2.0.0\r\n  - Did the problem appear with an update? Yes, 2.2.0.0\r\n  - A reproducible case if this is a bug, Dockerfiles with reproduction inside is best.\r\n\r\n  - Windows Version: Windows 10 Version 1903 Build 18362.592\r\n  - Docker Desktop Version: 2.2.0.0\r\n  - Are you running inside a virtualized Windows e.g. on a cloud server or on a mac VM: No\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the behavior\r\n  1. Create a simple docker-compose file like this:\r\n```\r\nversion: '2'\r\n\r\nservices:\r\n  bitnami3:\r\n    image: 'bitnami/symfony:1'\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - '.:/app'\r\n    environment:\r\n      - TZ=America/New_York\r\n      - SYMFONY_PROJECT_NAME=bitnami3\r\n    depends_on:\r\n      - nginx\r\n    networks:\r\n      - default\r\n  nginx:\r\n    image: 'bitnami/nginx:1.16'\r\n    ports:\r\n      - '8784:8080'\r\n    networks:\r\n      - default\r\n    depends_on:\r\n      - phpfpm\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - '.:/app'\r\n      - './bitnami3.conf:/opt/bitnami/nginx/conf/server_blocks/bitnami3.conf'\r\n  phpfpm:\r\n    image: 'bitnami/php-fpm:latest'\r\n    networks:\r\n      - default\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - '.:/app'\r\n\r\nnetworks:\r\n  default:\r\n    driver: bridge\r\n```\r\n\r\n  2. Create at the same level an Nginx conf file \"**bitnami3.conf**\"\r\n```\r\nserver {\r\n    server_name localhost;\r\n    root /app/bitnami3/public;\r\n    listen 0.0.0.0:8080;\r\n\r\n    location / {\r\n        try_files $uri /index.php$is_args$args;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    location ~ ^/index\\.php(/|$) {\r\n\t\tfastcgi_pass phpfpm:9000;\r\n        fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\\.php)(/.*)$;\r\n        include fastcgi_params;\r\n        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;\r\n        fastcgi_param DOCUMENT_ROOT $document_root;\r\n        internal;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    location ~ \\.php$ {\r\n        return 404;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n  3. Run docker-compose up -d\r\n  4. Normally you should access the demo page of symfony at localhost:8784\r\n  5. In your project directory, go to /var/cache/ and delete the folder \"dev\"\r\n  6. Refresh the web browser to recreate the cache folder\r\n  7. Delete again the folder dev in /var/cache\r\n  8. Open the container with docker exec -ti {ID} /bin/bash\r\n  9. Go to /app/bitnami2/var/cache then run ls -lsa\r\n10. The folder \"dev\" is not there, run now \"mkdir dev\"\r\n       - _mkdir: cannot create directory 'dev': File exists_\r\n\r\n11. This result that symfony can't recreate the cache folder and if your refresh your browser this time you will have: \r\n`Warning: file_put_contents(/app/bitnami2/var/cache/dev/App_KernelDevDebugContainerDeprecations.log): failed to open stream: No such file or directory`\r\n\r\nI don't know why that happen only with php-fpm and nginx. If I remove them and ONLY have a service with symfony, I can delete the cache folder as many time I want and every refresh Symfony will success to recreate the cache folder.\r\n\r\nMy english is not the best i'm sorry for that.\r\nIf more information is needed I'll keep an eye on this issue.","_id":"docker_for-win#5550","comments":[{"createdAt":"2020-01-23T12:38:43Z","body":"@coolfarmer thanks for the report (and your english is fine!)\r\n\r\nI tried it on my Mac and on my Windows host (since the file sharing is different).

Host and container quickly get back in sync and the app can repopulate the cache.\r\n\r\nPreviously (as you observed) you could get into a stuck out-of-sync state where the directory could not be created because it already existed from the container's point of view and yet it could not be removed because it didn't exist from the host's point of view.

Docker will run properly, and if i execute `docker exec -it webserver cat /var/www/html/index.html`, I will get \"kitten\", printed out. However, IF I edit `index.html` FROM the host, and replace let's say `kitten` with `kitty`, and right after I run `cat` on docker exec, I will get `kitten` most of the time, which means that mounted volume didn't sync with a host. After, 10 seconds, 30, one time even 30 minutes, `kitten` will turn into `kitty` and container will sync with a host. \r\n\r\n### Initial configuration\r\n* Docker for windows has container defined in `docker-compose` with mounted Windows directory as volume.\r\n* Mounted directory has index.html file with content `kitten`\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nRunning `cat /var/www/html/index.html` before editing index.html file should print `kitten`\r\nRunning `cat /var/www/html/index.html` should IMMEDIATELY after editing index.html content into `kitty` print out the same content that exists on host.\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n`cat /var/www/html/index.html` after random amount of time matches content on host (turns `kitten` into `kitty`)\r\n### Information\r\nBecause of simplification of the issue, I used index.html as a single file in this example. directory contains thousands of files (like any web project running around us). \r\nMounted volume indeed has really random syncs, sometimes it's 10 seconds, sometimes it's 30 minutes. \r\nSucceeded to reproduce on 3 same laptops, using same timezones, and same hardware, however I was unable to reproduce same issue on different laptop in different timezone. \r\nDocker images report UTC+0 as default timezone, while host uses US ET time.
